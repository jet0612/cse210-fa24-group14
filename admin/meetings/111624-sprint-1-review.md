Sprint Goal:
The focus of this sprint was to enhance the CI/CD pipeline, implement robust testing mechanisms, and improve the browser extension functionality.

Key Achievements:
CI/CD Improvements (Mitch):

Integrated PR linting to check for variable mismatch errors.
Automated detection of errors and improved commit message handling.
Enhanced code quality by incorporating end-to-end and unit testing.
Added a makefile for streamlined build processes, including commands to install without dependencies and perform dry runs.
Dry run functionality allows pre-checking fixes to ensure CI pipeline success after changes.
Unit Test Setup (Rashi):

Established a foundation for unit testing in the project.
Worked on setting up tests for specific features to improve code reliability.
Browser Extension Enhancements (Rashi):

Developed a rough HTML interface for testing.
Implemented a feature to dynamically fetch the browser extension ID using Playwright.
Enhanced browser interaction with background scripts and JavaScript, enabling interaction with active websites via a background worker.
Code Review and Merging (Shyam):

Facilitated basic merge functionality and ensured every team member could participate in code reviews.
Outstanding Issues:
Merge conflict in branch 004 that requires resolution.
Some features, such as extended tests for the browser extension, are still in progress.
