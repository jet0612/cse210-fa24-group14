CI/CD
  Mitch:  pr linting: check mismatch variable errors in code
            take care of commit message
          automatic detect error
          code quality, end to end, unit test
          rashi set up unit test
          make file added
          run install without dependency
          dry run? reason: if you fix it, CI will pass.

  Shyam:  basic merge, everyone could review
  Rashi:  rough HTML; test extension to add test with button, put into browser
          palywright: create instance of browser, go to our extension, 
          dynamicly fetch extension ID
          why background and JS? interact with the website you are on, need a background worker
